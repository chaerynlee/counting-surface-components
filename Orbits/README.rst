Orbits
======

Orbits is a python implementation of the Agol-Hass-Thurston algorithm
for counting the number of equivalence classes of an equivalence
relation on the set J = {1, ..., N} which is generated by gluing
subintervals by isometries. This can be used, for example, to compute
the number of components of a normal curve on a triangulated surface
or a normal surface in a triangulated 3-manifold.

Orbits can be run in Python 2 or Python 3.
